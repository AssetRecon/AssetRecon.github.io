I first became intersted in technology in general as a child while building gaming PC's with my brother, and I also enjoy the satisfication of learning new things. However the real reason why I decided to get into coding is because I realized while at my current place of employment, which is not tech related, that what I enjoyed the most out of my job were the situations where I was requried to problem solve, or find a creative solution to get over some sort of road block. 

Typically this came in the form of writing VBA macros or sophisticated formula based excel solutions. Soon I realized how coding would be able to not only seriously increase my work productivity, but also increase the overall enjoyment of how I accomplished my daily tasks. Additionally coding was already something that I had already taken up, but only in the capacity of a hobby.

I got into coding because its fun, challenging, and has the potential to take my career to the next level. Even with just the basic introductory level of coding knowledge I have now, I am able to problem solve and proprose solutions that I would otherwise never have thought of. I believe the next step for me is to leverage my current professional background in addition to my Flatiron School education in such a way that would enable me to fully embrace my passion for technology by helping people through problem solving by writing code.
