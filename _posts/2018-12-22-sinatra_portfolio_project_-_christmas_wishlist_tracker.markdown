For my 2nd portfolio project I decided to make a Christmas Wishlist Tracker to hep me keep track of all the gifts that all my friends and family members have been telling me that they wanted for Christmas. 

I found that getting started on this project was much easier than it was for my first project. After completed the lessons leading up to this project, especially the Fwitter project, I felt very confidnet in my ability to apply my newfound skills to create a simple CRUD app such as a wishlist tracker.

I feel that the main challenge was being able to take the idea I had pictured in my mind and translate it into code. I wold say setting up the databasse probably took me longer than it should have since while going through the learn ciriculum I typically did not have to set up all the configuration and environment files like I had to do this time. But once I got into the stride of things it actually became hard to stop because it was really satisfying to be creating an application that I know I can put to real use once I am finished with it. Of course I could just use an excel spreadsheet or any note taking app on my phone to do the same thing, but being that it was my own creation from scratch I felt highly motivated to get it working so that I could use it as soon as possible. 

After compelting the project I feel a strong sense of satisfaction. I am now able to create something that a couple months ago I probably would have no idea how to even approach.
